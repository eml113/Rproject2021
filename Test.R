# Write a function to compile data from all .csv files in a directory into a single .csv file. The compiled
# data should have the original twelve columns from daily data sheets, but also country and dayofYear
# columns. The user should be able to choose whether they want to remove rows with NAâ€™s in any
# columns, include NAs in the compiled data but be warned of their presence, or include NAs in the
# compiled data without a warning

## In other document! 

# Write a function to summarize the compiled data set in terms of number of screens run, percent of
# patients screened that were infected, male vs. female patients, and the age distribution of patients.
